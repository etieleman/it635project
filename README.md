# IT 635 Project - Enterprise Management System
This is a system which a company can use to track and view information regarding their technological assets, such as computers, phones, monitors, and so on. System allows for employees to request the use of assets, as well as the purchase of new assets and retirement of old ones, and allows a manager to approve or deny these requests.

For testing, the following credentials can be used to log in with the included .sql database:

fmg10/password10 - Manager Privileges

lol6/password6 - Employee Privileges

Code in functions.php uses the mysql credentials root/it635root to connect to database it635; change this if necessary
